About
The goal of hand sign language detection is to develop the applications that can understand and translate sign language into a text format
that can be understood by non-sign language users. This technology can enable communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not.
In this project I basically focus on producing a model which can recognize Fingerspelling based hand gestures in order to form a complete word by combining each gesture.
